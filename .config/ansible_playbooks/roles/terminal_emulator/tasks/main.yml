# Under aarch64 arch, we install alacritty (Since likely this is runnign in my mac VM)
# Under amd64 arch, we install kitty 



# - name: Perform Kitty install when the arch is amd64 Linux
#   include_tasks: "kitty.yml"
#   when: ansible_architecture == "x86_64" and ansible_system == "Linux"

- name: Perform wezterm install when the OS is linux
  include_tasks: "wezterm.yml"
  # when: ansible_architecture == "aarch64" and ansible_system == "Linux"
